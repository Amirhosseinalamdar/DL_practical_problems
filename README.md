# DL_practical_problems

## HW1
hw1 contains 3 main notebooks
* The first one is about pytorch basics and different operations on tensors and other pytoch properties.
* In NN_from_scratch, I implemented a vanilla MLP from scratch using numpy and trained it on mnist.
* In the main notebook, we implement different optimization methods like SGD or Adam and test them on Ackley and Baele functions.

## HW2
* HW2_CNN_TODO is introducing us to CNN architectures and asks us to implement a CNN arch on our choice, acquiring acc more than a threshold t. Also introduces us to feature maps.
* YOLO was about the YOLO model which is a CNN model of object detection. We implemented it from scratch.
* The last notebook is about implementing and training ResNet18 and UNet(for colorization) on Cifar10.

## HW3
this hw is about transformers and will be added soon
